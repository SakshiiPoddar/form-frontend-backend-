# üíå Sanrio-Themed Contact Form using Django

This is a simple and beautiful web-based contact form built with Django and styled using HTML and CSS. The design is inspired by Sanrio characters, giving it a soft, pastel look that feels friendly and cute. The form allows users to submit their name, email, and a message, which then shows a ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù page after successful submission.

To make this project work, Django is used as the backend. It handles user input, processes the form data, and renders the pages. The frontend part, including the design and layout, is done using clean HTML and CSS that match the Sanrio theme.

If someone wants to run this project on their own computer, they can follow a few easy steps. First, they need to install Python and Django. Then, they can clone the project from GitHub, create a virtual environment, and run the server using Django‚Äôs built-in command. After that, opening `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in the browser will show the contact form.

The project has two main pages: one is the contact form itself, and the second is the thank you page that appears after form submission. You can also customize it further by connecting it to Gmail. If you do that, it can send an actual email every time someone submits the form. For this, you‚Äôll need to turn on 2-Step Verification in your Gmail account and create an App Password, which is then used in Django‚Äôs settings.

This project is perfect for anyone who is learning Django and wants to create something visually appealing and fully functional. It‚Äôs easy to understand, simple to set up, and a great way to practice building forms and handling user data in a secure way.

Feel free to explore the code, customize the design, and use it in your own projects. This project is open-source and free to use.
